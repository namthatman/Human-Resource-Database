Hello, teacher.

Today I am going to show you how to use Database application

When you open application, what you will see is User's Interface.
In order to modify data, you have to pass Username and Password correctly, "C##VU" and "duonghoanvu" respectively.
Then it shows you other theme. There, you can Insert, Update, Delete data.
Furthermore if you need to retrieve a particular item, you could pass its name or ID into bar above large table in the middle of page.

Hopefully you enjoy our application
